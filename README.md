# Curriculum Vitae

Just my CV. If people are interested in either reading it, or using the source, here it is.

The latex is basically taken from [here](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/classicthesis-styled-cv).

The email logo is public domain. I imagine the twitter logo may not be public domain, but I also imagine twitter are happier the more people use it.
